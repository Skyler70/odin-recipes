        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Prepare the Pickled Chilies one day in advance</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Wontons:</strong></li>
            <p>Combine all the Wontons ingredients together (except wrappers). Stir to mix well. 
                Place a teaspoon of the pork mixture in the middle of each wonton wrapper. 
                Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water. Seal the edges to form a triangle shape. 
                Bring the two corners down, pinch to form a Chinese ingot. (You may also keep the wontons in triangle shape.) 
                Repeat the same steps until you use up all the pork mixture. Set aside on a plate until ready to cook.
            </p>

            <li><strong>Garlic Oil:</strong></li>
            <p>Heat the oil in a pan and fry the garlic over low-medium heat 
                until it starts to turn lightly golden in color and crisp. 
                Transfer immediately to a heat proof bowl and set aside.
            </p>

            <li><strong>Prepare Mushroom Sauce:</strong></li>
            <p>Soak the mushrooms in 1 cup warm water until softened. Squeeze the excess water from the mushrooms, 
                set aside the mushrooms but reserve the mushroom water. Slice the mushrooms into pieces.
            </p>

            <p>Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small saucepan. Stir fry the garlic and mushrooms for 1 minute. 
                Add the rest of the ingredients except for the cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. 
                Stir in the cornstarch mixture, let the sauce thicken a bit. 
                Taste and adjust the seasonings, if desired. Turn off the heat, cover the saucepan and set aside.
            </p>

            <li><strong>Prepare Vegetables:</strong></li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and sugar. 
                Blanch the choy sum stems first, followed by the leaves. Remove, drain and set aside.
            </p>

            <li><strong>Cook Wontons:</strong></li>
            <p>Boil some water in pot and cook the wontons in batches for about 1-2 minutes until cooked. 
                Stir occasionally to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pot. 
                Drain and set aside. Alternatively, 
                add them to some prepared chicken broth and garnish with spring onions.
            </p>

            <li><strong>Prepare Noodles:</strong></li>
            <p>In a shallow serving bowl, place 1 serve of the seasoning sauce.</p>

            <p>With the same boiling water used for blanching the vegetables, bring it to a rolling boil, 
                and cook 1 bundle (100 g / 3oz.) of noodles for about 30 seconds or until done to your liking. 
                Use a large sieve to drain the noodles and run it under cold running tap water for 5 seconds, 
                then dip the noodles in the boiling water again just to warm it up. 
                Transfer the noodles into the serving bowl and toss them in the seasoning sauce. 
                Add 6 tbsp of the mushroom sauce and toss again. Add a dash of white pepper.
            </p>

            <p>Garnish the noodles with choy sum, wontons and sliced char siu pork. 
                Serve immediately wth pickled green chillies and a bowl of wonton soup. 
                If you like it spicy, mix the noodles with some Sriracha chilli sauce.
            </p>
